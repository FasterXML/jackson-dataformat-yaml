# Overview

This project contains [Jackson](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) extension component for reading and writing [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) encoded data.
[SnakeYAML](http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/) library is used for low-level YAML parsing.
This project adds necessary abstractions on top to make things work with other Jackson functionality.

# Status

As of version 2.5, project is production ready.

## Maven dependency

To use this extension on Maven-based projects, use following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-yaml</artifactId>
  <version>2.6.3</version>
</dependency>
```

# Usage

## Simple usage

Usage is as with basic `JsonFactory`; most commonly you will just construct a standard `ObjectMapper` with `com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.yaml.YAMLFactory`, like so:

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(new YAMLFactory());
User user = mapper.readValue(yamlSource, User.class);
```

but you can also just use underlying `YAMLFactory` and parser it produces, for event-based processing:

```java
YAMLFactory factory = new YAMLFactory();
JsonParser parser = factory.createJsonParser(yamlString); // don't be fooled by method name...
while (parser.nextToken() != null) {
  // do something!
}
```
